# My Hometown

This was a Scrimba project. Our goal was to make a page that showed information about our hometown. We initially learned how to do it by building one of Torshov, Norway, where Per Borgen of Scrimba fame is from. I did that, and then, instead of just customizing it to make it reflect where I live, I built 3 other pages and added a menu, turning it into a small multi-page website.

I made pages for Yonkers, NY, which is where I'm from and Chino Hills, CA, the city I live in as of this writing (Jan 2023). I also modified the homepage completely and used it to discuss differences in cuisine between Yonkers & Chino Hills.
