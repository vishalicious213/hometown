# My Hometown

This was a solo project for Module 2 (Web Development Basics) of Scrimba's [Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). The goal was to make a page that showed information about my hometown. I initially learned how to do it by building one of Torshov, Norway, where __Per Borgen__ of Scrimba fame is from. After that, instead of just customizing it to reflect where I live, I built 3 other pages and added a menu, turning it into a small multi-page website.

I made pages for my hometown of Yonkers, NY, and for Chino Hills, CA, the city I live in as of this writing (Jan 2023). I also modified the homepage completely and used it to discuss differences in cuisine between Yonkers & Chino Hills.
