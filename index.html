        <p class="cities-text">There's a lot to like about to CA, just like there's a lot I miss about NY. I'm a foodie at heart, and both places deliver. NY is famous for pizza, bagels, pastrami and an amalgamation of food from all over the world. Our diners are legendary and the city never sleeps, so you can generally find something for your cravings regardless of whether its the sun or moon lighting your way. Also, our water is better than everywhere else in the country - although Nordic countries do have us beat there.</p>
        <p class="cities-text">Los Angeles is a stone's throw from Chino Hills and its food scene has influenced the area. There's fantastic Mexican fare - completely different from what we have back home. It's called Cali-Mex, and is different from Tex-Mex and what I grew up with. Korean BBQ, Thai, Filipino, sushu, ramen and more here are great. Like Mexican, their Chinese is different from ours, and there's so much more Japanese food - but NY has about 50k Japanese people living there. CA has 500k.</p>
        <p class="cities-text">There's little in the way of Carribean food. I'm used to an abundance of Trinidadian roti shops, Jamaican spots and other South American delicacies. Its different out west. There's little-to-no Carribean presence. There aren't Dominican and Puerto Rican places dotting the streets. I think they have some Peruvian spots. But there's so much more I haven't found here yet.</p>
        <p class="cities-text">I haven't found any Malaysian places. There are some Indonesian though. I miss my beef rendang! There's more Vietnamese spots here than in NY. Not as many as San Fran though. There's a dearth of Jewish delis, I drove through a Little Ethiopia, they have a big Armenian population, there are Greek places. I've heard of Russian spots here, but not Ukrainian. I haven't checked out any Mid-Eastern places yet, and I hear fantastic things about the local mom & pop donut shops.</p>
        <p class="cities-text">Indian here isn't bad, but Liberty Ave, back home, is a notch above. They do have Indian pizza here, which isn't a thing back home. Pies with chicken tikka masala or chutney or other things are waiting for me to try them. Pizza shops rarely sell by the slice, it's a whole pie or nothing. There are also sushi burritos, which I've fallen in love with, and poke here is wonderful, although I hear its unbelievable in Hawaii.</p>
        <p class="cities-text">Their city sleeps, unlike NY. Places close down at night. There's a bare handful of eateries open in the small hours. However, the French dip sandwich was invented in LA. The Mexican burrito was brought to the US here. Fusions like bulgogi burritos and tacos were invented here, and its possible that the California roll was invented here - I originally heard that it was born in Canada. Also, surprisingly, the cheeseburger comes from here as well!</p>
